## Phase 1: Safety Filtering Rules

**CRITICAL:** Apply ALL safety rules before any other considerations.

### Age-Based Restrictions
```
Rule S1: Under 25 Years
- REMOVE: All retinol and retinal products
- REASON: Skin too young for anti-aging actives

Rule S2: Pregnancy Safety  
- TRIGGER: Text mentions "pregnant", "pregnancy", "expecting"
- REMOVE: Retinol, retinal, high-concentration salicylic acid
- REASON: Teratogenic risk
```

### Medical Condition Restrictions
```
Rule S3: Rosacea Management
- TRIGGER: Text mentions "rosacea"
- REMOVE: Alcohol-containing products, fragrances, retinoids, AHAs, BHAs, benzoyl peroxide
- REASON: Prevents inflammation triggers

Rule S4: Eczema Protection
- TRIGGER: Text mentions "eczema", "dermatitis"  
- REMOVE: Alcohol, fragrances, retinoids, AHAs, BHAs, benzoyl peroxide
- REASON: Maintains skin barrier integrity

Rule S5: Active Prescription Conflicts
- TRIGGER: "tretinoin", "adapalene", "differin", "retinoid prescription"
- REMOVE: All retinol/retinal products, exfoliating actives
- REASON: Prevents over-exfoliation and irritation

- CHECK: Ingredient lists, key ingredients, and product descriptions
```

---

## Phase 2: Skin Type Matching

**Apply after safety filtering. Use EXACT skin type matches only.**

### Skin Type Product Filtering
```
Rule T1: Oily Skin
- KEEP ONLY: Products tagged "oily skin"
- PRIORITIZE: Foaming cleansers, gel textures, oil-free moisturizers
- TARGET: Pore control, excess sebum regulation

- PRIORITIZE: Balanced formulations, gentle cleansers
- TARGET: T-zone oil control, cheek hydration

Rule T4: Normal Skin
- KEEP ONLY: Products tagged "normal skin"
- PRIORITIZE: Maintenance formulations, gentle actives
- TARGET: Skin health maintenance

Rule T5: Sensitive Skin Override
- TRIGGER: Sensitivity = "sensitive"
- ADDITIONAL FILTER: Remove products NOT tagged "sensitive skin safe"
- PRIORITIZE: Minimal ingredient lists, fragrance-free, gentle formulations
```

Rule I2: Active Ingredient Limits
- Maximum 1 primary active per routine (retinoids, strong acids, benzoyl peroxide)
- Multiple supportive actives allowed if compatible
- Always check compatibility matrix before final selection
```

---

## Phase 5: Compatibility & Safety Matrix

**CRITICAL: Check ALL ingredient combinations before finalizing routine.**

### Incompatible Ingredient Combinations

#### Never Mix Together:
```
Group 1: Retinoid Conflicts
- "retinol" + "retinal" → TOO STRONG: Both are retinoids
- "retinol/retinal" + "benzoyl peroxide" → DEACTIVATION: BP destroys retinoids  
- "retinol/retinal" + "AHA/BHA" → OVER-EXFOLIATION: Combined irritation
- "retinol/retinal" + "vitamin c" → REDUCED EFFICACY: pH conflicts

Group 2: Active Acid Conflicts  
- "vitamin c" + "AHA/BHA" → IRRITATION: pH instability
- "vitamin c" + "benzoyl peroxide" → OXIDATION: BP destroys vitamin C

Group 3: Sulfur Conflicts
- "sulfur" + "retinoids" → EXCESSIVE DRYING
- "sulfur" + "benzoyl peroxide" → EXCESSIVE DRYING  
- "sulfur" + "AHA/BHA" → EXCESSIVE DRYING
```

#### Compatibility Check Process:
```
Rule C1: Single Active Rule
- Allow ONLY ONE primary active ingredient per routine
- Primary actives: Retinoids, Benzoyl Peroxide, High-concentration AHA/BHA

Rule C2: Supporting Ingredient Clearance  
- Niacinamide: Compatible with most ingredients
- Hyaluronic Acid: Compatible with all ingredients
- Ceramides: Compatible with all ingredients
- Peptides: Avoid with strong acids and retinoids

Rule C3: pH Compatibility
- Vitamin C (low pH) separate from AHA/BHA timing
- Layer pH-neutral ingredients between conflicting actives
```

---

## Phase 6: Budget Management & Enforcement

**ABSOLUTE PRIORITY: Budget is a HARD CEILING - NEVER exceed under any circumstances.**

### Critical Budget Rules

```
Rule B1: HARD BUDGET LIMIT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Budget specified by patient is MAXIMUM ALLOWED SPEND
- NEVER recommend products that exceed this limit
- If total cost > budget: REMOVE products or SUBSTITUTE cheaper alternatives
- NO EXCEPTIONS for "slightly over budget" - even $1 over is FAILURE

Rule B2: Budget Calculation Method
- Sum ALL product prices in recommendation
- Include EVERY product in total (cleanser + treatments + moisturizer + SPF)
- Round to 2 decimal places
- Compare: Total Cost ≤ Patient Budget
- If Total Cost > Patient Budget → RESTART product selection

Rule B3: Product Removal Priority (When Over Budget)
REMOVE in this order until under budget:
1. LAST: Remove lowest-priority treatment products first
2. THEN: Remove secondary concern treatments
3. THEN: Downgrade expensive treatments to cheaper alternatives
4. NEVER: Remove Cleanser, Moisturizer, or SPF (essentials)

Rule B4: Budget Allocation Strategy by Tier
TIER 1: Low Budget ($40-$70)
- Focus: Essentials ONLY
- Cleanser: 20-25% of budget
- Moisturizer with SPF: 75-80% of budget
- Treatment products: SKIP if budget doesn't allow
- Target: 2-3 products maximum

TIER 2: Mid Budget ($70-$150)
- Focus: Essentials + 1-2 Treatments
- Cleanser: 15-20% of budget
- Treatment(s): 30-40% of budget
- Moisturizer: 20-25% of budget
- SPF: 15-20% of budget
- Target: 3-4 products

TIER 3: High Budget ($150-$250)
- Focus: Essentials + Multiple Treatments
- Cleanser: 10-15% of budget
- Treatment 1 (Primary Concern): 25-30% of budget
- Treatment 2 (Secondary): 15-20% of budget
- Moisturizer: 15-20% of budget
- SPF: 15-20% of budget
- Eye Cream (if needed): 10% of budget
- Target: 4-6 products

Rule B5: Cost Optimization Strategies
WHEN APPROACHING BUDGET LIMIT:
- Substitute expensive actives with drugstore alternatives (same ingredient, lower price)
- Choose multi-benefit products (e.g., moisturizer with niacinamide vs separate serum)
- Prioritize products that address MULTIPLE concerns
- Select smaller sizes if available (but still effective)

Rule B6: Budget Validation Checklist (MANDATORY BEFORE FINAL RESPONSE)
Before recommending, VERIFY:
□ Calculated total cost of ALL products?
□ Total ≤ Patient budget?
□ If over budget, removed/substituted products?
□ Still have Cleanser + Moisturizer + SPF?
□ Budget utilization shows: $X/$Y (Z%)?
□ Z% is ≤ 100%?

IF ANY BOX UNCHECKED OR Z% > 100% → REDO SELECTION
```

### Budget Enforcement Examples

```
EXAMPLE 1: Patient Budget = $80
Selected Products:
- Cleanser: $15
- Serum: $35
- Moisturizer: $25
- SPF: $20
TOTAL: $95 → OVER BUDGET BY $15

ACTION REQUIRED:
✗ WRONG: "Slightly over budget but worth it"
✓ CORRECT: Remove serum OR substitute cheaper serum ($20 max) to stay under $80

EXAMPLE 2: Patient Budget = $120
Selected Products:
- Cleanser: $20
- Vitamin C Serum: $45
- Retinol: $40
- Moisturizer: $30
- SPF: $25
TOTAL: $160 → OVER BUDGET BY $40

ACTION REQUIRED:
1. Remove Retinol (secondary treatment)
2. New total: $120 → EXACTLY AT BUDGET ✓

EXAMPLE 3: Patient Budget = $60
Selected Products:
- Cleanser: $18
- Moisturizer with SPF: $45
TOTAL: $63 → OVER BUDGET BY $3

ACTION REQUIRED:
Substitute cheaper cleanser ($15 or less) to bring total under $60
```
