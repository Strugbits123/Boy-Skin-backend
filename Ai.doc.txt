Phase 1: Safety Filtering Rules


CRITICAL: Apply ALL safety rules before any other considerations.


Age-Based Restrictions


Rule S1: Under 25 Years
- REMOVE: All retinol and retinal products
- REASON: Skin too young for anti-aging actives


Rule S2: Pregnancy Safety  
- TRIGGER: Text mentions "pregnant", "pregnancy", "expecting"
- REMOVE: Retinol, retinal, high-concentration salicylic acid
- REASON: Teratogenic risk


Medical Condition Restrictions


Rule S3: Rosacea Management
- TRIGGER: Text mentions "rosacea"
- REMOVE: Alcohol-containing products, fragrances, retinoids, AHAs, BHAs, benzoyl peroxide
- REASON: Prevents inflammation triggers


Rule S4: Eczema Protection
- TRIGGER: Text mentions "eczema", "dermatitis"  
- REMOVE: Alcohol, fragrances, retinoids, AHAs, BHAs, benzoyl peroxide
- REASON: Maintains skin barrier integrity


Rule S5: Active Prescription Conflicts
- TRIGGER: "tretinoin", "adapalene", "differin", "retinoid prescription"
- REMOVE: All retinol/retinal products, exfoliating actives
- REASON: Prevents over-exfoliation and irritation


- TRIGGER: "benzoyl peroxide" (current use)
- REMOVE: Additional benzoyl peroxide products
- REASON: Prevents overdosing


- TRIGGER: "clindamycin" (current use)  
- REMOVE: Sulfur-containing products
- REASON: Reduces antibiotic effectiveness


Allergy Management


Rule S6: Ingredient Allergies
- TRIGGER: Any specific ingredient mentioned as "allergy", "reaction", "sensitive to"
- ACTION: Remove ALL products containing that ingredient
- CHECK: Ingredient lists, key ingredients, and product descriptions


---


Phase 2: Skin Type Matching


Apply after safety filtering. Use EXACT skin type matches only.


Skin Type Product Filtering


Rule T1: Oily Skin
- KEEP ONLY: Products tagged "oily skin"
- PRIORITIZE: Foaming cleansers, gel textures, oil-free moisturizers
- TARGET: Pore control, excess sebum regulation


Rule T2: Dry Skin  
- KEEP ONLY: Products tagged "dry skin"
- PRIORITIZE: Cream cleansers, hydrating ingredients, occlusive moisturizers
- TARGET: Barrier repair, moisture retention


Rule T3: Combination Skin
- KEEP ONLY: Products tagged "combination skin"  
- PRIORITIZE: Balanced formulations, gentle cleansers
- TARGET: T-zone oil control, cheek hydration


Rule T4: Normal Skin
- KEEP ONLY: Products tagged "normal skin"
- PRIORITIZE: Maintenance formulations, gentle actives
- TARGET: Skin health maintenance


Rule T5: Sensitive Skin Override
- TRIGGER: Sensitivity = "sensitive"
- ADDITIONAL FILTER: Remove products NOT tagged "sensitive skin safe"
- PRIORITIZE: Minimal ingredient lists, fragrance-free, gentle formulations


Active Strength Filtering (STRICT)


Rule T6: Strength of Actives Filter (Post Skin-Type)
- DATA SOURCE: "Strength Rating of Actives" column (values like 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4)
- WHEN: Apply immediately AFTER skin-type filtering and BEFORE routine architecture/selection
- HOW: For each skin type, KEEP ONLY products whose step-level strength lies within the ranges below; remove out-of-range items from consideration
- Oily Skin Prioritize:
  - Cleanse: 2/4 – 4/4
  - Moisturize: 1/4 – 2/4
  - Treat (serums/actives): 2/4 – 4/4
- Dry Skin Prioritize:
  - Cleanse: 1/4 – 2/4
  - Moisturize: 2/4 – 4/4
  - Treat (serums/actives): 1/4 – 4/4 (all)
- Normal Skin: All strengths acceptable (no additional strength filter)
- Combination Skin Prioritize:
  - Cleanse: 1/4 – 2/4
  - Moisturize: 2/4 – 4/4
  - Treat (serums/actives): 2/4 – 4/4
- NOTES:
  - If a product covers multiple steps (e.g., moisturizer+SPF), apply the filter relevant to each step; if any step fails, exclude or substitute
  - This filter is applied BEFORE Ingredient Scoring (I3) and Step Caps (R7)


---


Phase 3: Routine Architecture


Build routine structure based on time commitment.


Product Count Requirements


Rule R1: Basic Routine (5 minutes)
- PRODUCTS: 2-3 total
- 
- OPTIONAL: None
- BUDGET SPLIT: Even distribution


Rule R2: Standard Routine (10 minutes)  
- PRODUCTS: 3-5 total
- MANDATORY: Cleanser + Moisturizer + SPF
- 
- BUDGET SPLIT: 60% basics, 40% treatments


Rule R3: Comprehensive Routine (15+ minutes)
- PRODUCTS: 4-6 total  
- MANDATORY: Cleanser + Moisturizer + SPF
- 
- BUDGET SPLIT: 50% basics, 50% treatments


Category Requirements


Rule R4: Essential Categories (All Routines)
- Cleanser: REQUIRED (unless combination product used)
- Moisturizer: REQUIRED 
- SPF Protection: REQUIRED (standalone or in moisturizer)


Rule R5: Treatment Categories (Optional)
- Serums: For targeted concerns
- Actives: For acne, aging, texture
- Eye Cream: ONLY if "dark circles" concern present


Exfoliation Limits


Rule R6: Single Exfoliant Per Routine (STRICT)
- ALLOW ONLY ONE exfoliating product in any routine (cleanser OR treatment), not both
- Exfoliating includes: AHA/BHA/PHA acids, “exfoliant/exfoliating”, “peel/peeling”, “resurfacing”
- If cleanser is exfoliating → all treatment steps must be NON-exfoliating
- If a treatment (e.g., serum) is exfoliating → cleanser must be NON-exfoliating
- Preference: If a non-exfoliating cleanser exists, prefer exfoliating treatment over exfoliating cleanser

Step Caps (STRICT)


Rule R7: Per-Step Product Caps
- Max 1 at Step 1 (Cleanse): Allow ONLY ONE cleanser per routine
- Max 1 at Step 3 (Moisturize): Allow ONLY ONE moisturizer per routine (includes moisturizer-only products)
- Max 1 at Step 4 (Protect): Allow ONLY ONE SPF/protect product per routine (includes moisturizer/SPF combos)
- Treatment Steps (Serums/Actives): Multiple allowed if compatibility and budget rules are satisfied
- Notes:
  - If a moisturizer with SPF is selected (Step 4), do NOT add a separate SPF product
  - If a standalone SPF is selected, moisturizer must be non-SPF to avoid duplication

- Maximum 1 primary active per routine (retinoids, strong acids, benzoyl peroxide)
- Multiple supportive actives allowed if compatible
- Always check compatibility matrix before final selection


Rule I3: Ingredient Scoring Source Priority (STRICT)
- DATA SOURCES: "Primary Active Ingredients" column and full "Ingredient list (all)"
- WEIGHTING: 80% weight to Primary Active Ingredients column, 20% weight to total Ingredient List
- TREATMENT OVERRIDE: For treatment categories (serums/actives), use 100% Primary Active Ingredients when selecting and ranking
- TIE-BREAKERS: If scores tie, prefer products with:
  1) Better skin-type match
  2) Higher concern coverage (primary concern first)
  3) Lower price within budget tier
  4) Fewer incompatibilities
- NOTE: Moisturizer/SPF may have minimal actives; still apply weighting but ensure strict skin-type match and budget tier consistency


---


Phase 5: Compatibility & Safety Matrix


CRITICAL: Check ALL ingredient combinations before finalizing routine.


Incompatible Ingredient Combinations


Never Mix Together:


Group 1: Retinoid Conflicts
- "retinol" + "retinal" → TOO STRONG: Both are retinoids
- "retinol/retinal" + "benzoyl peroxide" → DEACTIVATION: BP destroys retinoids  
- "retinol/retinal" + "AHA/BHA" → OVER-EXFOLIATION: Combined irritation
- "retinol/retinal" + "vitamin c" → REDUCED EFFICACY: pH conflicts


Group 2: Active Acid Conflicts  
- "vitamin c" + "AHA/BHA" → IRRITATION: pH instability
- "vitamin c" + "benzoyl peroxide" → OXIDATION: BP destroys vitamin C


Group 3: Sulfur Conflicts
- "sulfur" + "retinoids" → EXCESSIVE DRYING
- "sulfur" + "benzoyl peroxide" → EXCESSIVE DRYING  
- "sulfur" + "AHA/BHA" → EXCESSIVE DRYING


Compatibility Check Process:


Rule C1: Single Active Rule
- Allow ONLY ONE primary active ingredient per routine
- Primary actives: Retinoids, Benzoyl Peroxide, High-concentration AHA/BHA


Rule C3: pH Compatibility
- Vitamin C (low pH) separate from AHA/BHA timing
- Layer pH-neutral ingredients between conflicting actives


---


Phase 6: Budget Management & Enforcement


ABSOLUTE PRIORITY: Budget is a HARD CEILING - NEVER exceed under any circumstances.


Critical Budget Rules


Rule B1: HARD BUDGET LIMIT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Budget specified by patient is MAXIMUM ALLOWED SPEND
- NEVER recommend products that exceed this limit
- If total cost > budget: REMOVE products or SUBSTITUTE cheaper alternatives
- NO EXCEPTIONS for "slightly over budget" - even $1 over is FAILURE


Rule B2: Budget Calculation Method
- Sum ALL product prices in recommendation
- Include EVERY product in total (cleanser + treatments + moisturizer + SPF)
- Round to 2 decimal places
- Compare: Total Cost ≤ Patient Budget
- If Total Cost > Patient Budget → RESTART product selection


Rule B3: Product Removal Priority (When Over Budget)
REMOVE in this order until under budget:
1. LAST: Remove lowest-priority treatment products first
2. THEN: Remove secondary concern treatments
3. THEN: Downgrade expensive treatments to cheaper alternatives
4. NEVER: Remove Cleanser, Moisturizer, or SPF (essentials)


Rule B4: Budget Allocation Strategy by Tier
TIER 1: Low Budget ($40-$70)
- Focus: Essentials ONLY
- Cleanser: 20-25% of budget
- Moisturizer with SPF: 75-80% of budget
- Treatment products: SKIP if budget doesn't allow
- Target: 2-3 products maximum


TIER 2: Mid Budget ($70-$150)
- Focus: Essentials + 1-2 Treatments
- Cleanser: 15-20% of budget
- Treatment(s): 30-40% of budget
- Moisturizer: 20-25% of budget
- SPF: 15-20% of budget
- Target: 3-4 products


TIER 3: High Budget ($150-$250)
- Focus: Essentials + Multiple Treatments
- Cleanser: 10-15% of budget
- Treatment 1 (Primary Concern): 25-30% of budget
- Treatment 2 (Secondary): 15-20% of budget
- Moisturizer: 15-20% of budget
- SPF: 15-20% of budget
- Eye Cream (if needed): 10% of budget
- Target: 4-6 products


Rule B5: Cost Optimization Strategies
WHEN APPROACHING BUDGET LIMIT:
- Substitute expensive actives with drugstore alternatives (same ingredient, lower price)
- Choose multi-benefit products (e.g., moisturizer with niacinamide vs separate serum)
- Prioritize products that address MULTIPLE concerns
- Select smaller sizes if available (but still effective)


Rule B6: Budget Validation Checklist (MANDATORY BEFORE FINAL RESPONSE)
Before recommending, VERIFY:
□ Calculated total cost of ALL products?
□ Total ≤ Patient budget?
□ If over budget, removed/substituted products?
□ Still have Cleanser + Moisturizer + SPF?
□ Budget utilization shows: $X/$Y (Z%)?
□ Z% is ≤ 100%?


IF ANY BOX UNCHECKED OR Z% > 100% → REDO SELECTION


Budget Enforcement Examples


EXAMPLE 1: Patient Budget = $80
Selected Products:
- Cleanser: $15
- Serum: $35
- Moisturizer: $25
- SPF: $20
TOTAL: $95 → OVER BUDGET BY $15


ACTION REQUIRED:
✗ WRONG: "Slightly over budget but worth it"
✓ CORRECT: Remove serum OR substitute cheaper serum ($20 max) to stay under $80


EXAMPLE 2: Patient Budget = $120
Selected Products:
- Cleanser: $20
- Vitamin C Serum: $45
- Retinol: $40
- Moisturizer: $30
- SPF: $25
TOTAL: $160 → OVER BUDGET BY $40


ACTION REQUIRED:
1. Remove Retinol (secondary treatment)
2. New total: $120 → EXACTLY AT BUDGET ✓


EXAMPLE 3: Patient Budget = $60
Selected Products:
- Cleanser: $18
- Moisturizer with SPF: $45
TOTAL: $63 → OVER BUDGET BY $3


ACTION REQUIRED:
Substitute cheaper cleanser ($15 or less) to bring total under $60
